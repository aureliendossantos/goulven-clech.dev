> [WORK IN PROGRESS]

After almost two years of procrastinating, I finally launched a blog.

Besides illegitimacy and lack of time, the main reason not to launch earlier was that I needed a blogging technology that amused me... Until my friend <GithubInline user="3019731" /> introduced me to <LinkInline to="https://astro.build/">Astro</LinkInline>, THE best Static Site Generator right now.

Let me explain what sets Astro apart, especially if you're new to web development, and how it helped me launch my blog ðŸš€

## What's a Static Site Generator?

Before seeing how Astro works, you need to understand two concepts:

Firstly, a "<LinkInline to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page">Static Site</LinkInline>" consists of HTML pages delivered to the browser exactly as they are stored, unlike a "dynamic" site where a server will generate HTML pages based on user requests.

Therefore a static site allows us to do without a server, which can be expensive and unreliable, and use a <LinkInline to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">Content Delivery Network</LinkInline>. <LinkInline to="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</LinkInline> or <LinkInline to="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</LinkInline>, for example, are free solutions to host your static blogs.

Secondly, a "<LinkInline to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator">Site Generator</LinkInline>" takes, on the one hand, a template describing the appearance of your site and, on the other hand, text files representing the content. With those two entries, the software generates all your website's pages.

For developers, it's not just a time saver but allows content to be stored in simple text files rather than a database. The files are then editable in a simple code editor, easily exported, and can be stored with the rest of the code.

Since the genesis of SSGs with <LinkInline to="https://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</LinkInline> and <LinkInline to="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</LinkInline>, those softwares have become popular among techs like us. However, the general experience is still "nerdy" and requires not being scared by a code editor or command lines... Explaining the general public's preference for <LinkInline to="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</LinkInline>, yet more expensive and less reliable.

And even for a developer like me, the experience offered by most SSGs can be frustrating. I won't go through every failed attempt, but let's divide them into large families:

- The "traditional" SSGs. Whose are often either hermetic or poorly integrated into the NodeJS ecosystem (cutting off access to many valuable libraries for web development).
- The "modern" SSGs. build on top of huge JS frameworks, preventing correct performances or being decently reliable.
- The "niche" SSGs. Which are made with fantastic and modern languages but whose poor documentation and nascent ecosystem will drain my time.

## Why Astro stand out?

Astro's proposal is simple but appealing: offering a JavaScript SSG that does not ship any JS by default.

This means, first, an easy-to-understand SSG for all web developers: all you need is to understand HTML/CSS, JS basics, and how to install a dependency with NPM (NodeJS Package Manager).

You will write your templates with JSX, a syntax popularised by React, blending HTML with JS. Above the template, you can do your imports and functions in plain JS (or TypeScript, but we'll talk about that later); or even use your favorite libraries, which you can simply install via NPM.

```js del={6} add={7}
import React from "react"

export default function Home() {
	return (
		<div>
			<h1>Hello World!</h1>
			<h1>My new title!</h1>
		</div>
	)
}
```

But what is the difference with other javascript SSGs? Astro will not ship your code into a huge JavaScript application, but only generate simple HTML pages. Astro produces no client-side JS, reducing page weight and ensuring good performance by default.

However, you can still add a `<script>` tag to run client-side code. Even better, if you can't do without a JS framework, the "Astro Islands" allow you to inject a specific component in the middle of a classic Astro page.

<FigImage
	src={Image0}
	alt="Cover"
	caption="Astro Islands"
/>

I think I summed up the spirit of Astro pretty well. On the one hand, it is an SSG that aims for simplicity: which uses known languages, a simple syntax, and generates simple HTML pages... And on the other hand, an SSG does not close any door: you can use all your NPM libraries, ship client-side JS, and even integrate other JS frameworks...
