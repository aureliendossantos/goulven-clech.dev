I've always drunk coffee, probably like you, without great pleasure nor understanding much about it.

I thought "good" coffee was dark, bitter, intense coffees that our fathers drank grimacing... So understand my surprise when I first heard an expert talk about coffee:

In October 2021, the videomaker Tom Scott explained that he didn't like coffee as a kid and wanted to re-evaluate his judgment. He invited James Hoffmann, a world-champion barista and a coffee YouTuber, to re-introduce him to coffee.

Through several tastings, they will use terms I had never heard describing coffees: fruity, sweet, acid, fermented, fresh... And since it didn't take much to pique my curiosity, I fell into it.

## Tickle the curiosity

After the video with Tom, I devoured James Hoffman's Youtube channel and those of European Coffee Trip and Morgan Eckroth. They gave me a glimpse of how much richer and more complex coffee is than I thought.

Two videos stand out:

In this video, James Hoffmann tests Nespresso capsules, a product I regularly drink, unlike specialty coffees.

He explained well why the coffee I knew tasted wood, and dared to say that bitter and astringent flavors were not a sign of quality... But burnt beans. In fact, dark roasting is an excellent way for industrials to hide poor raw materials.

The second video comes from the Epicurious channel, featuring Dillon Edwards. The expert will taste several pairs of coffee and successfully guess the most expensive ones every time. Proving that coffee has different qualities, clearly distinguishable in blind-tasting.

Now convinced I've never had real coffee, I searched Google Maps for "Specialty Coffee". Later, I was at a barber shop in Toulouse, where the small roaster Hayuco had a counter.

In addition to tasting my first specialty coffees, I had a long discussion with Oriane, one of Hayuco's roasters. With her and all the coffee professionals I have met until today, I am glad to have never met elitism, but always enthusiasts enchanted to see new faces and answer your questions.

I left with my first bag of coffee beans, and the book "Le café c'est pas sorcier" by S. Racineux and C-L. Tran. This a reading that I would recommend to all French-speaking beginners, whether for its presentation of the history of coffee, the different regions, or the different preparation methods. For an English-speaking alternative, turn to "How to make the best coffee at home" by James Hoffman (him again).

## Few addresses in Toulouse

For a "small" city of ~500,000 souls, Toulouse surprisingly has a lot of lovely places around coffee. For this first article, let's focus on the four coffee roasters I've met and loved:
