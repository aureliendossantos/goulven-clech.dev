> WORK IN PROGRESS

After almost two years of procrastinating, I finally launched a blog.

Besides illegitimacy and lack of time, the main reason not to launch earlier was that I needed a blogging technology that amused me...

Until my friend <GithubInline user="3019731" /> introduced me to <LinkInline to="https://astro.build/">Astro</LinkInline> !

## What's a Static Site Generator?

Before seeing how Astro works, you need to understand two concepts:

Firstly, a "<LinkInline to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page">Static Website</LinkInline>" consists of web pages delivered to the browser exactly as they are stored, unlike a "dynamic" site where a server will generate the pages based on user requests.

Therefore a static site won't need server, which can be expensive and unreliable, and can use a free <LinkInline to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">Content Delivery Network</LinkInline> like <LinkInline to="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</LinkInline> or <LinkInline to="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</LinkInline> for examples.

Secondly, a "<LinkInline to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator">Site Generator</LinkInline>" is the software that will generate your pages by taking, on the one hand, a template describing the appearance of your site and, on the other hand, text files representing the content.

Storing context in text files rather than a database is not only a time saver, but allows to edit them in a simple code editor, easily export them, store them with the rest of the code, and use a versioning system like <LinkInline to="https://git-scm.com/">Git</LinkInline> to track changes!

Since the genesis of SSGs with <LinkInline to="https://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</LinkInline> and <LinkInline to="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</LinkInline>, those softwares have become popular among devs like us. However, the general experience is still "nerdy" and requires not being scared by a code editor or command lines... Explaining the general public's preference for <LinkInline to="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</LinkInline>, yet more expensive and less reliable.

And even for us, the experience offered by most SSGs can be frustrating. I won't go through every failed attempt, but let's divide them into large families:

- The "traditional" SSGs. Whose are often either hermetic or poorly integrated into the JavaScript (JS) ecosystem (cutting off access to many valuable libraries for web development).
- The "modern" SSGs. build on top of huge JS frameworks, preventing correct performances or being decently reliable.
- The "niche" SSGs. Which are made with fantastic and modern languages but whose poor documentation and nascent ecosystem will drain my time.

## Why Astro stand out?

Astro's proposal is simple but appealing: offering a JS SSG that does not ship any JS by default.

This means, first, an easy-to-understand SSG for all web developers. All you need is to understand HTML/CSS, the JS basics, and how to install a software with NPM... So the ABC of web development.

You can already write your first templates with JSX, a syntax popularised by React blending HTML with JS. Add your style with basics CSS stylesheets. Write your content in Markdown, a simple syntax for text formatting. And that's it, your Astro blog is ready!

Astro won't ship your code into a huge JS application, but only generate simple HTML pages. So no client-side JS by default, reducing page weight and ensuring good performance by default.

However, Astro is fully integrated into the JS ecosystem. If you need any JS logic or use any NPM library, you can do it above the template and it will be executed at build time. And if you need client-side JS, you can simply add a `<script>` tag to your template that will be injected into the page.

Even better, if you can't do without a JS framework, the "Astro Islands" allow you to inject a specific component in the middle of a classic Astro page.

```js
example of a Astro component with build time logic, client side JS,
a React component, and JSX templating.
```

I think I summed up the spirit of Astro pretty well. On the one hand, it is an SSG that aims for simplicity: which uses known languages, a simple syntax, and generates simple HTML pages... And on the other hand, an SSG does not close any door: you can use all your NPM libraries, ship client-side JS, and even integrate other JS frameworks...

## How Astro help beginners

Obvious answer -> great CLI, geat tooling, great documentation, great integrations.

First, it's great by default -> default options are set intelligently, Astro enforce good practice, even if you don't know them yet. Example of images (with alt attribute).

Second, you don't learn Astro, you learn web development -> Astro wrap HTML/CSS api but don't alter it too much (example: of `<a>` against `<Link>`), Astro made simple the basics of web development without hiding them, also the basics of Astro are easy to understand (SSG, client side vs server side, etc) and not build of top a gas factory (SPA router, shadow dom, etc), you can complexify your Astro app as you learn web development.

## Conclusion

Astro is not perfect -> It's not a magic wand, you still have to learn web development, with all its inconsistency and frustrating complexity -> JS still sucks, lack consistency, abstractions, and its hard to learn, even with TypeScript -> the ecosystem is sometimes still lacking (CMS still sucks).

But Astro make the web development easier. Easier to learn, easier to ship, easier to maintain. Also the community is great, and the team behind Astro is very active and friendly.

The software grow fast and (most of the time) intelligently. With more and more of big companies using it, like : UNDP, Google, Microsoft, Ikea, NordVPN, The Guardian, Trivago, Cloudflare, etc.

I think Astro is the best SSG available, it made building my blod fun and easy, and I hope you will give it a try.
