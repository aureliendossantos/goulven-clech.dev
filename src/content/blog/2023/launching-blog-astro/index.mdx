After almost two years of procrastinating, I finally launched a blog.

Besides illegitimacy and lack of time, the main reason not to launch earlier was that I needed a blogging technology that amused me...

Until my friend <GithubInline user="3019731" /> introduced me to <LinkInline to="https://astro.build/">Astro</LinkInline> !

## What's a Static Site Generator?

Before seeing how Astro works, you need to understand two concepts:

Firstly, a "<LinkInline to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page">Static Website</LinkInline>" consists of web pages delivered to the browser exactly as they are stored, unlike a "dynamic" site where a server will generate the pages based on user requests.

Therefore a static site won't need server, which can be expensive and unreliable, and can use a free <LinkInline to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">Content Delivery Network</LinkInline> like <LinkInline to="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</LinkInline> or <LinkInline to="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</LinkInline> for examples.

Secondly, a "<LinkInline to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator">Site Generator</LinkInline>" is the software that will generate your pages by taking, on the one hand, a template describing the appearance of your site and, on the other hand, text files representing the content.

Storing context in text files rather than a database is not only a time saver, but allows to edit them in a simple code editor, easily export them, store them with the rest of the code, and use a versioning system like <LinkInline to="https://git-scm.com/">Git</LinkInline> to track changes!

```md title="basic_text.md"

This is my first blog post, I hope you will enjoy it!
```
  
```jsx title="basic_template.html"
<main>
  <h1>{title}</h1>
  <p>{content}</p>
  <p>Published on {date}</p>
</main>
```

Since the genesis of SSGs with <LinkInline to="https://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</LinkInline> and <LinkInline to="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</LinkInline>, those softwares have become popular among devs like us. However, the general experience is still "nerdy" and requires not being scared by a code editor or command lines... Explaining the general public's preference for <LinkInline to="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</LinkInline>, yet more expensive and less reliable.

And even for us, the experience offered by most SSGs can be frustrating. I won't go through every failed attempt, but let's divide them into large families:

- The "traditional" SSGs. Whose are often either hermetic or poorly integrated into the JavaScript (JS) ecosystem (cutting off access to many valuable libraries for web development).
- The "modern" SSGs. build on top of huge JS frameworks, preventing correct performances or being decently reliable.
- The "niche" SSGs. Which are made with fantastic and modern languages but whose poor documentation and nascent ecosystem will drain my time.

## Why Astro stand out?

Astro's proposal is simple and unique: offering a JS SSG that does not ship any JS by default.

This means, first, an easy-to-understand SSG for all web developers. All you need is to understand HTML/CSS, the JS basics, and how to install a package with NPM... So the ABC of web development.

<FigImage

  alt="Cover"
  caption="In a few seconds, put your project into orbit with the CLI wizard ðŸ§™"   
/> 

You can already write your first templates with JSX, a syntax popularised by React blending HTML with JS. Add your style with basics CSS stylesheets. Write your content in Markdown, a simple syntax for text formatting. And that's it, your Astro blog is ready to be shipped!

Astro won't ship your content into a huge JS application, but only generate simple HTML pages. So no client-side JS by default, reducing page weight and ensuring cosmic performance.

/>

However, Astro is fully integrated into the JS ecosystem. If you need any JS logic or use any NPM library, you can do it above the template and it will be executed at build time. And if you need client-side JS, you can simply add a `<script>` tag to your template that will be injected into the page.

Even better, if you can't do without a JS framework, the "Astro Islands" allow you to inject a specific component in the middle of a classic Astro page. 

```js
example of a Astro component with build time logic, client side JS,
a React component, and JSX templating.
```

I think I summed up the spirit of Astro pretty well. On the one hand, it is an SSG that aims for simplicity: which uses known languages, a simple syntax, and generates simple HTML pages... And on the other hand, an SSG open on the JS galaxy: you can use all your NPM libraries, ship client-side script, and even integrate other frameworks...

## How Astro help beginners

Let's swift the obvious answer: Yes, Astro has a stellar CLI, a comprehensive documentation, and a great <LinkInline to="https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/">tutorial for your first blog</LinkInline>. And yes, as <GithubInline user="3019731" /> said on her blog, you should not underestimate the power of Astro's <LinkInline to="https://erika.florist/articles/dontunderestimateeditorintegration">good editor tooling!</LinkInline>

But, on a deeper level, I think that two fundamental aspects of Astro's philosophy makes it the perfect launchpad:

First, unlike traditional web development, you don't have to understand all the best practices to make a decent site: Astro's default options are set intelligently, will raise warnings when you forget important things, and will ensure good performance through their simplicity. Getting started is easy, and you will be able to understand and modify those settings at your own pace.

<FigImage
  src={ImageAstroImages}
  alt="Astro lightouse average score 98, Gatsby 68, Next.JS 63, Wordpress 58"
  caption="An example with Images where Astro optimizes your image by default, using a modern format, including the loading and decoding attributes, and pushing you to fill the alt attribute (for accessibility) and dimensions (to avoid Cumulative Layout Shift)."
  source="https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/"
/>

Second, unlike hefty JS frameworks, you will not immediately be thrown between a shadow DOM and a SPA router, chaotically wrestling with black magic before understanding the basics... Being a web developer should be mainly learning CSS/HTML/JS/DOM APIsâ€”which Astro does not dramatically alter! 

By wrapping web APIs and maintaining simplicity, Astro ensures that most web documentation applies to your project (like MDN HTML/CSS documentation) and doesn't ask you to learn a complex stack. Then, delving deeper, you will slowly master web development, its essential technologies, its most common tools, and their best practices... Not just a web framework.

## Conclusion

Of course, Astro is not a magic wand: You still have to learn web development, with all its inconsistency and frustrating complexity. JS still sucks, lacks consistency and abstractions. TypeScript helps, but keeps flawed data structure designs (mutability and hash tables everywhere) and adds some poorly designed types (I'm still angry about their """tagged union"""). And you will still encounter cryptic errors, especially from Vite (Astro's bundler) and JS's "undefined" type...

But Astro make the web development easier: easier to learn, easier to ship, easier to maintain... And more fun!

Now is the perfect time to start, as the software is experiencing fast and intelligent growth, attracting major companies like Google, Microsoft, UNDP, Ikea, Vercel, NordVPN, The Guardian, Trivago, Cloudflare... And, unlike in space, we can hear you scream on the really active <LinkInline to="https://astro.build/chat">Discord server</LinkInline>, where you can meet the friendly and helpful core team.
