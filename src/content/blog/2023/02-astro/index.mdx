After almost two years of procrastinating, I finally launched this blog.

Besides illegitimacy and lack of time, the main reason not to launch earlier was that all the <LinkInline to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator">Static Site Generators</LinkInline> I had used so far weren't fun...

But that was before my friend <GithubInline user="3019731" /> introduced me to <LinkInline to="https://astro.build/">Astro</LinkInline>, THE best SSG available, especially if you are new to web development. Let me explain why in this first article, and share a few tips I learned along the way.

## What was I looking for?

I won't go through every SSG that has failed me, but let's divide them into large families:

- The famous "blasting fast" SSGs. Whose massive JS frameworks prevent reaching correct performances or being decently reliable.
- The "traditional" SSGs. Whose are often either hermetic or poorly integrated into the NodeJS ecosystem (cutting off access to many valuable libraries for web development).
- The "niche" SSGs. Which are made with fantastic and modern languages but whose poor documentation and nascent ecosystem will drain my time.

To summarize, I was looking for an SSG that is: well integrated into the NodeJS ecosystem but ships minimum JS in production; well designed and documented to allow quick learning; and finally, both statically typed and with world-class IDE integration for my development comfort.

Finally, this new SSG should fit my blog AND be a strong candidate for my more ambitious projects. Like <LinkInline to="https://fairedesjeux.fr//">FaireDesJeux</LinkInline>'s refactor, a collaborative website to learn how to create video games, run by <LinkInline to="https://gamedevalliance.fr/">Game Dev Alliance</LinkInline>.

So you guessed it, I finally found a stack approaching these objectives: <LinkInline to="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</LinkInline> and <LinkInline to="https://astro.build/">Astro</LinkInline>. So let's dive into it!

## Why climb into Astro's rocket?
