> [WORK IN PROGRESS]

After almost two years of procrastinating, I finally launched this blog.

Besides illegitimacy and lack of time, the main reason not to launch earlier was that all the <LinkInline to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator">Static Site Generators</LinkInline> I had used so far weren't fun...

But that was before my friend <GithubInline user="3019731" /> introduced me to <LinkInline to="https://astro.build/">Astro</LinkInline>, THE best SSG available, especially if you are new to web development. Let me explain why in this first article, and share a few tips I learned along the way.

## What's a Static Site Generator?

Well, the name is self-explanatory:

- "Site Generator" means software that takes templates of what your web pages should look like and flat-text files of your content, then generate all the web pages you need from those inputs.
- "Static Site" suggests a website that will not change depending on the user. It won't need a web server to handle user inputs & generate pages on the fly, but will serve plain HTML files created and stored earlier.

Since the genesis of SSG with <LinkInline to="https://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</LinkInline> and <LinkInline to="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</LinkInline>, those softwares have become particularly popular for blogging. All you have to do is write your articles in a text file, save your blog template with the content on <LinkInline to="https://en.wikipedia.org/">GitHub</LinkInline> or <LinkInline to="https://en.wikipedia.org/">GitLab</LinkInline>, and use a free <LinkInline to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">Content Delivery Network</LinkInline> (rather than renting a server) to host your blog.

This concept is extremely simple and practical; unfortunately, due to a generally "nerdy" experience, these softwares are mainly used by developers' blogs. The general public prefers <LinkInline to="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</LinkInline>, yet more expensive, less reliable, and less efficient.

## What was I looking for?

I won't go through every SSG that has failed me, but let's divide them into large families:

- The famous "blasting fast" SSGs. Whose massive JS frameworks prevent reaching correct performances or being decently reliable.
- The "traditional" SSGs. Whose are often either hermetic or poorly integrated into the NodeJS ecosystem (cutting off access to many valuable libraries for web development).
- The "niche" SSGs. Which are made with fantastic and modern languages but whose poor documentation and nascent ecosystem will drain my time.

To summarize, I was looking for an SSG that is: well integrated into the NodeJS ecosystem but ships minimum JS in production; well designed and documented to allow quick learning; and finally, both statically typed and with world-class IDE integration for my development comfort.

Finally, this new SSG should fit my blog AND be a strong candidate for my more ambitious projects. Like <LinkInline to="https://fairedesjeux.fr//">FaireDesJeux</LinkInline>'s refactor, a collaborative website to learn how to create video games, run by <LinkInline to="https://gamedevalliance.fr/">Game Dev Alliance</LinkInline>.

So you guessed it, I finally found a stack approaching these objectives: <LinkInline to="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</LinkInline> and <LinkInline to="https://astro.build/">Astro</LinkInline>. So let's dive into it!

## Why climb into Astro's rocket?

Astro's proposal is simple but appealing: offering a JavaScript SSG that does not ship any JS by default.

This means, first, an easy-to-understand SSG for all web developers: all you need is to understand HTML/CSS, JS basics, and how to install a dependency with NPM (NodeJS Package Manager).

You will write your templates with JSX, a syntax popularised by React, blending HTML with JS. Above the template, you can do your imports and functions in plain JS (or TypeScript, but we'll talk about that later); or even use your favorite libraries, which you can simply install via NPM.

<FigCode
  code={`  <div>
    <h1>Un titre</h1>
    <p>Voici du texte.</p>
  </div>`}
  lang="html"
  caption="test"
/>

But what is the difference with other javascript SSGs? Astro will not ship your code into a huge JavaScript application, but only generate simple HTML pages. Astro produces no client-side JS, reducing page weight and ensuring good performance by default.

However, you can still add a `<script>` tag to run client-side code. Even better, if you can't do without a JS framework, the "Astro Islands" allow you to inject a specific component in the middle of a classic Astro page.

I think I summed up the spirit of Astro pretty well. On the one hand, it is an SSG that aims for simplicity: which uses known languages, a simple syntax, and generates simple HTML pages... And on the other hand, an SSG does not close any door: you can use all your NPM libraries, ship client-side JS, and even integrate other JS frameworks...
